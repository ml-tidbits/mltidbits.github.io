		We're two MIT students trying to bring understandable explanations and discussions about artificial intelligence and machine learning to the public!
		<br><br>
		Check out our ML Tidbits YouTube channel for short and sweet explanations, discussions, and debates about ML topics.	Our goal is to make ML accessible to the public, so that everyone can participate in discussions and make educated decisions about ML products and policies.
