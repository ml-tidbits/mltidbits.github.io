		Are you interested in learning about AI but not really a techy person? 
		<br> 
		Are you trying to understand the math behind an ML concept or method? 
		<br>
		Or are you just trying to see if you can create something cool using ML?

		We're two MIT PhD students trying to bring understandable explanations and discussions about artificial intelligence and machine learning to the public!
		<br><br>
		Check out our ML Tidbits <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD7qIRMUvUJQzbTXaMaNO2Q'>YouTube channel</a> for short and sweet explanations, discussions, and debates about ML topics.  Our goal is to make ML accessible to the public, so that everyone can participate in discussions and make educated decisions about ML products and policies.  We believe that teaching responsible ML from the start will create more accountability and enable better public discussions around the societal impacts of this technology.
